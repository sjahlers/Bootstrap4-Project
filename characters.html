					<p>Piper Elizabeth Chapman (Taylor Schilling) is a woman who was sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary for helping her former girlfriend Alex Vause smuggle drug money in Europe several years before the first episode. At the series start, Piper appears to be a somewhat innocent woman who strives to be on her best behavior and not get in trouble with any of the inmates while doing her time quietly. However, throughout the series, as she spends more time in prison, a darker side of Piper is revealed.</p>

					<p>Alex Vause (Laura Prepon) is a former drug smuggler for an unspecified international drug cartel. Years prior to the beginning of the series, she took a sexual interest in Piper after meeting her in a bar, and gradually integrated her into the drug trade while they traveled the world living in luxury. Alex is snarky, manipulative and street smart. While she does associate with other inmates, she keeps to herself emotionally, although she isn't afraid to fight back if provoked. </p>

In her earlier life, she and her husband ran a struggling restaurant in Queens, eventually getting involved with the Russian mafia bosses who frequented their establishment.  Though a serious woman, Red can be known for being occasionally sentimental (especially for the women in her care) and humorous.</p>

				<div class = "col-sm-4 col-md-6 p-3 orangebox">
					<p>Suzanne "Crazy Eyes" Warren (Uzo Aduba) is a mentally unstable inmate with a violent history, however generally passive and friendly. An African-American, she was raised by an adoptive middle class white couple who later had another daughter during Suzanne's childhood. Suzanne was often shunned by her parents' community and her little sister's friends.  She is easily upset and is quickly frustrated, usually resulting in her hitting herself on the head and calling herself "stupid."  When getting to know her better, her compassion and thoughtfulness become apparent.</p>

					<p>Tasha "Taystee" Jefferson (Danielle Brooks) is a very funny person, who mainly stays within the group of black inmates. She claims to prefer life in "the system" over "the outside."  Despite her less than ideal upbringing and often outrageous behaviour, she is highly intelligent, and shows great ambition.  Taystee finds herself being assigned as Caputo's secretary. She uses her new position to influence some of the decisions Caputo makes on behalf of the inmates.</p>
